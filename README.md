## Abstract

> The paradigm of Decentralized Identity (DI) represents a profound architectural shift in digital interaction, promising to enhance user privacy and autonomy. However, the existing body of research has largely concentrated on component-level cryptographic security, overlooking the emergent, system-level dynamics. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing a novel theoretical framework that models DI ecosystems as large-scale, complex socio-technical systems. We provide the first "Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)" that re-contextualizes a DI ecosystem as a dynamic system governed by powerful feedback loops. We then develop a formal state-space representation, modeling the ecosystem as a Networked Control System (NCS) where concepts like trust and adoption are state variables, governance policies are control inputs, and systemic attacks are adversarial disturbances. Using this model, we apply Lyapunov stability theory to derive provable, quantitative conditions for ecosystem resilience, transforming the abstract goal of stability into a verifiable mathematical property. Furthermore, we reframe security through the lens of robust control theory, enabling the analysis of and defense against a new class of systemic threats—such as reputation manipulation and trust-cascades—that are invisible to traditional cryptographic threat models. This work establishes a new theoretical foundation for reasoning about the stability and security of next-generation internet architectures, providing architects and regulators with a rigorous, formal methodology for designing and analyzing provably resilient DI ecosystems.

## Compiling the LaTeX Document

The easiest way to compile the paper is to use a cloud-based LaTeX editor like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).

### Instructions for Overleaf

1.  **Create a New Project:** Start a new project using the official **Springer Nature LaTeX Template**.
2.  **Upload Files:**
    * Delete the default `sn-article.tex` and `sn-bibliography.bib` files from the template.
    * Upload the `sn-article.tex` and `sn-bibliography.bib` from this repository.
    * Upload the figures (`simulation_response.png`, `lyapunov_function_plot.png`) or run the Python script to generate them.
3.  **Set Main Document:** Ensure `sn-article.tex` is set as the main document.
4.  **Compile:** Click "Recompile". The Springer Nature template (`sn-jnl`) handles the complex compilation sequence automatically. If you encounter reference errors, use the **"Recompile from scratch"** option.

The main LaTeX packages required are listed in the preamble of `sn-article.tex` and are standard in most TeX distributions.
